	<p>Key principles to be taken care of while building Kalvi. These cannot be compromised and one factor should not compromise the other.</p>

	<h3>Simplicity</h3>

	<p>There is no equivalent of 37Signals basecamp SaaS for education segment. Even if we do something similar, we must put a LOT of emphasis on simplicity. Not only on UI, it must occur on all fronts, like pricing/billing, moving across formats(like SCORM, XBlock) etc. We can write a lot of documents and pdfs for the products, but nobody would bother to read through wads of manuals just to figure out how to invite a new user to the course. Time spent on documentation can be channelized into time spent on making the product simpler and easier to use.</p>

	<h3>Build for enterprise</h3>
	<p>Learning is serious. Serious not in the "you won't get a job if you dont learn" sense. It is serious because people invest time and money to augment their skills. They expect a minimum guarantee, like a badge, or a job. That's why it is always better to build a premium product than give it for free. When you are building a premium product, it goes without saying that you are building for the enterprise. This will dismiss all the classle stereotypes as it is not built for the enterprise. It might have won the "traction" war by having X users, Y courses, N quizzes etc. but seriously, not even 10 people would have benefited from the system. If we were to go between traction and enterprise readiness, I'd anyday go for the latter.</p>

	<h3>Ecosystem</h3>
	<p>We can't create a world class product or enterprise ready product if there is no ecosystem. Moodle is a classic example of this. They took a lot of time to make a stable product, ended up creating a whole new ecosystem around their product. We can start with the SaaS platform, add a course marketplace, a portal for people to showcase their skills and build their portfolio. More about ecosystem in a separate document.</p>

	<h3>Collaboration</h3>
	<p>An LMS can't be everything to everybody. Even if we add all the features, it will become a huge monolithic block which is difficult to manage. What's worse, we compromise simplicity. We connect our LMS with tools which do things best via LTI standards. More about LTI in a separate document.</p>


	<h3>Minimizing cost of change</h3>
	<p>Adopting our product or trying it out should be cheap. We should not have a huge signup form, lockin of content, complicated pricing, unclear terms and conditions etc. Users should be able to quickly try it out, evaluate features and take decisions with minimum friction. They must be able to come out of our product if need be without any hassle. So, we must give them the option to export to SCORM, import from SCORM, export student data in a convenient format, import it from systems like moodle. It should at least be interoperable with popular ones like moodle, canvas,blackboard etc.</p>

	<h3>Open standards</h3>
	<p>Our product should be embracing open standards wherever possible. Ex: use HTML5 instead of flash, export content as SCORM instead of our own format. Otherwise, this will jeopardize the collaboration and ecosystem factors. Whether our product itself should be open source or not is a question which will be discussed once we get some traction and the ecosystem is in place.</p>
